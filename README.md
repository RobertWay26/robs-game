# robs-game
A 2D game built in Unity. Through this project I learned how to design my own custom assets. This include all of the sprites and music featured in the game. There is no offial build of the game (yet). This project has been more of a hobby and I spent most of my time designing the characters, map, and music rather than developing a story line.
